# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A visual demonstration of various sorting algorithms implemented in Python using tkinter.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Features

- Interactive GUI built with tkinter
- Real-time visualization of sorting process
- Algorithm statistics (comparisons, swaps, execution time)
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed
- Multiple sorting algorithms to choose from

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- tkinter (usually comes with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
cd sorting-visualizer
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application with `python main.py`
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the menu
3. Adjust the array size and sorting speed using the sliders
4. Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization
5. Watch as the algorithm sorts the array in real-time
